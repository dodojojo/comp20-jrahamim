Assignment 4:
==============
The project was completed as requested, both basic requirements and 3 additional 
implementations were fulfilled:

Added features:
1) Game loads on first page load
2) Frogger can be moved with the UP DOWN LEFT RIGHT keys
3) Animated vehicles and logs rendered to the screen
4) Collision detection:if Frogger is hit by a vehicle or hits water, then a life is lost
5) Basic Scoring including: 10pts for successful furthest step forwards,
							50pts for getting a frogger home
							1000pts for getting 5 froggers home

Additional implementations:
6) Added Level difficulties (cars get faster)
7) Added sound into the game
8) Animated dead frogger
9) Added highscore tracking and storage to the game (because why not?)
10) Partially implemented the rest of the scoring including a working timer with 10pts
	awarded per second of time left after getting a frogger home, and a fly that awards
	the player with 200pts. Ms Frogger was not implemented.

Future development goals:
	Full 3D
	Cutscenes
	Bullet time
	User can be a car instead
	User can be a log instead (no input allowed)
	MMO expansion pack
	First person perspective
	Ability to send constant facebook updates
	Hats


Assignment 2:
=============

The assignment has been completed with a reusable function to render all the necessary
items to the screen, as well as a reusable initializer function to reset game variables
at the start of a new game.
Also hopefully the code is well commented. A word on the structure of the code, I wrote
it with turning it into the full game later in mind, which is why the structure seems a
bit weird for this assignment (there's a game loop, the game itself is a class, there
are player and object classes seemingly just to hold the graphics etc).

I didn't work with anyone on this assignment.


I spent roughly 4hrs on this.
