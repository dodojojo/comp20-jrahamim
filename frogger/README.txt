Assignment 2:
=============

The assignment has been completed with a reusable function to render all the necessary
items to the screen, as well as a reusable initializer function to reset game variables
at the start of a new game.
Also hopefully the code is well commented. A word on the structure of the code, I wrote
it with turning it into the full game later in mind, which is why the structure seems a
bit weird for this assignment (there's a game loop, the game itself is a class, there
are player and object classes seemingly just to hold the graphics etc).

I didn't work with anyone on this assignment.


I spent roughly 4hrs on this.
