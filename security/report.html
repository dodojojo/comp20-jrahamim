	<h2> Comp 20 A6: Security Analysis  </h2>
	
	<h3>Introduction: </h3>
	<p> The score centre web app is designed to store the score submissions of games
		securely, and return the users' information upon request. Since anyone can submit
		or access scores, this is assumed to be part of the functionality of the app, 
		and doesn't pose a security concern.
	</p>
	<p>
		The aim of this report is to analyze the security underlying the application,
		and see if users information is safe from being tampered with by an external
		source, or if the app is vulnerable to attacks from malicious users rendering the
		service unavailable.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Methodology: </h3>
	<p>
		The source code for the scorecenter web app was first read to look for potential
		security risks, and then probed by launching the site as a heroku app, and hosting
		it on the local machine. I attempted to use some of the security software such as 
		BurpSuite, however I failed to figure out how to use the software effectively.		
	</p>
	<p>
		Security risks that were analyzed were the safety of user data, the ability to 
		perform cross site scripting and the limits on the uploading of user information.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Abstract of Findings: </h3>
	<p>
	1) Lack of security on user input
	<ul>
		<li>Any user can send or receive data from any web page on the app</li>
		<li>Potential for malicious users to upload scripts to the database crashing the 
		site or redirecting other users away from the index page on loading</li>
		<li>By similar cross site scripting, malicious users can change or delte other
		users scores. </li>
		<li> users can send very large amounts of data crashing the app and filling up the
		 app's available storage.
	</ul>
	</p>
	
	<p>
	1) No User Verfication
	<ul>
		<li>Any user can observe anyone else's data</li>
		<li>If the app were expanded to store users sensitive data, this data can be easily
		 accessed by a remote script.</li>
		<li> Marketing companies can crawl through user scores and target users based
		on the information provided by this app.</li>

	</ul>
	</p>
	
	<h3>Issues Found: </h3>
	<p>
	1) Issue: No Sanitation of User Input
	<ul>
		<li>Location: web.js</li>
		<li>Severity of Issue: High</li>
		<li>Description of Issue: User submissions are not sanitized or analyzed for
		 security risks in any way. This means cross site scripting may occur, for example
		  a user can submit some code in script tags, such as redirecting from the site, 
		  which would be executed any time the information is called for, which is always
		   on the index page.</li>
		<li>Resolution: Sanitize the user input. Check for suspicious characters such as
		 curly brackets or angled brackets, and either remove them from the input, or
		 reject the user input outright.</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	
	<p>
	2) Issue: No Limit on User Submissions
	<ul>
		<li>Location: web.js</li>
		<li>Severity of Issue: High</li>
		<li>Description of Issue: There is no limit to how much information a user can 
		submit. This poses an issue as the mongodatabase has a finite size. It wouldn't
		take long to create a script that continuously submits valid inputs, or even
		send one input with a terabyte string in one of the fields, that would 
		immediately deplete all available space in the database, preventing any further
		submissions, or crashing the website when accessing the index (as the client
		side downloads all the information).</li>
		<li>Resolution: Check for the size of the user submission. If it is over a certain
		limit (e.g. 1mb) reject the submission. Also have a script that checks to see if 
		submissions from a user are coming in with unusual frequency (e.g. from an external
		script) and reject those submissions.</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	
	<p>
	3) Issue: Cross Origin Sharing Enabled on All Routes
	<ul>
		<li>Location: web.js</li>
		<li>Severity of Issue: Medium</li>
		<li>Description of Issue: Cross Origin Sharing is enabled on on routes in the app
		meaning that any web page can send and receive data directly from the app's 
		various api's. this is not a huge issue at the moment as all the present api's
		either require or benefit from the cross origin sharing, but with future 
		development some routes might need to be protected, e.g. routes containing 
		sensitive user information, and cross origin will still be enabled.</li>
		<li>Resolution: The routes to have cross origin enabled should be coded in 
		explicitly rather than doing app.all, do it in the definition of each route.</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	
	<p>
	4) Issue: No User Verification
	<ul>
		<li>Location: web.js</li>
		<li>Severity of Issue: Low</li>
		<li>Description of Issue: Anyone can search for anyone else's high score. If a
		user playing a game values their privacy, they dont have that with this app as
		any other user can see exactly how well they have done in all their games using 
		the user search page. A script by a marketing company could crawl through
		scores by users to find ones with higher relative scores and taget them for 
		gaming marketing.</li>
		<li>Resolution: A registration system for the site which could allow users
		to make their scores private.</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	
	<h3>Conclusions: </h3>
	<p>
		There are many good features of the scorecenter app yet it suffers from many immediate
		security risks that would allow even low skilled malicious users to manipulate information
		stored in the database and cause the site to crash or behave erratically. There is also
		the potentially expensive issue of it being very easy to cause the database to run
		out of room. There are also issues preventing good security of the features of the app were expanded, such as
		cross origin sharing for all pages and no user verification.
