Web Programming class at Tufts University Department of Computer Science, Spring 2013
======================================================================================

2) My favorite assignment was a4, creating the game frogger. Video games are fun!

3) I'm most proud of a5, setting up the heroku app. It was very non trivial and needed
    many pieces of knowledge but in the end I got it set up!

4) I've learned a whole lot. I started with zero knowledge of web programming and now
  I feel like I can make a fully functioning website or web application that anyone can
  access and that uses the most current technologies in web programming today. I have
  a greater appreciation for how the world wide web works, as well as the importance 
  of security in web design, and just how tricky it can be. The Mcgraw talk in particular
  helped me see that.
