Assignment 3:
=============

All parts have been implemented that is:
1) All red lines stations have been mapped using google maps and a custom icon
2) When clicked, station icons display information about arrival times and directions	
   of trains to the station.
3) A Polyline is rendered showing the red line route
4) The user location is found and marked on the map. The closest station is located and 
	its locations and distance away from the user in miles is shown on the map
5) Carmen and Waldo (if around) are shown at their positions on the map. Clicking on their
   Markers reveals the distance away from the user in miles.
   
This assignment took me roughly 7hrs.

I didn't work with anyone on this project.
